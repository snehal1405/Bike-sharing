# Ride sharing companies like Uber and Lyft are great business models that provide convenient, affordable and efficient 
transportation options for customers who want to go to places without the hassle of owning or operating a vehicle. However, 
with the increasing number of automobiles, riding sharing in cars are not efficient enough especially in crowded and busy 
areas like cities' downtown. Therefore, bike sharing is a brilliant idea which provides people with another short range 
transportation option that allows them to travel without worrying about being stuck in traffic and maybe enjoy city view or 
even workout at the same. In fact, bike sharing programs in the United States started about 15 years before Uber's ride share 
program started.
